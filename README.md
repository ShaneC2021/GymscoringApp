## Usage/ Features
Can be used by any judge at any competition independent of any server or database. User just needs an internet connection, a computer or mobile device and it's off to the races. Could be particularly useful to smaller gym clubs hosting meets who may need a simple cheap scoring solution.  As there is no need to rent devices or pay for some of the more expensive scoring systems that are currently on the market.
Even if a club has paid for a scoring system and for some reason the database or server is down , this can be used as a backup to calculate and print scores.

Built in timer to assist with timing of routines and warmups.
